## A simple(r) way to add a nice looking navigation menu to UWP apps

This package includes the navigation button, menu and page headers as implemented in
the [XAML navigation UWP sample](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/tree/master/Samples/XamlNavigation)
by Microsoft, modified so as to work out of the box with the empty UWP app project as generated by visual studio.

## Differences with original

Logic, styling and behavior is intended to be the same as the sample.

The biggets difference from original is that the application keeps a frame as the content of the root window and handles navigation as usual.
The navigation menu is placed in every individual page that needs it instead: this is particularly useful in media applications where some views should
only expose content - navigation is handled by the system back button.
